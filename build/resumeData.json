    "bio": "Hi, everybody! I am Kush. I have been coding for over two years now. As a front-end developer and QA, I have worked with both large companies and small businesses to develop & take their business on the internet & improve the user experience of their users. In doing so, I have found that I am very interested in the projects that challenge me. I mainly take on front-end projects. The clients I have worked with are satisfied, and I expect to add many more soon.",
